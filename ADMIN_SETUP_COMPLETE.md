## 🔧 Technical Details

### Password Requirements
All passwords must meet the following criteria:

- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

### User Roles

### Database Schema
The database includes comprehensive user fields:
- Basic info (name, email, phone)
- Professional info (organization, title, credentials)
- Contact info (address, emergency contacts)
- Security info (email/phone verification, failed login tracking)
- System info (creation date, last login, active status)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy Updated API**: The admin endpoints are ready but need to be deployed to Azure
2. **Test Admin Dashboard**: Once deployed, test the admin dashboard functionality
3. **Configure Frontend**: Update the admin dashboard to use the new API endpoints
4. **Add More Features**: Implement additional admin functionality as needed

## 📝 Notes

- All admin users have been created with comprehensive profile information
- The system includes proper input validation and security measures
- JWT tokens are configured for 24-hour expiration
- The database is properly secured with firewall rules
- All API endpoints include proper error handling and logging

## 🚨 Security Considerations

- All passwords are hashed using BCrypt
- JWT tokens are properly signed and validated
- Admin endpoints require proper authentication and authorization
- Database connections are encrypted
- Input validation prevents SQL injection and other attacks
