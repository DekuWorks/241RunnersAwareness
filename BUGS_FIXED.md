# Bugs Fixed - January 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Mission Statement Updated
**Issue:** Mission statement on home page didn't match About Us page  
**Fixed:**
- Updated hero section mission statement in `index.html`
- Updated welcome section mission statement in `index.html`
- Both now correctly state: "241 Runners Awareness is dedicated to honoring the memory of Israel Thomas and supporting and protecting missing and vulnerable individuals through real-time alerts, secure data management, and community engagement."

### 2. ‚úÖ Runner Status Default Changed
**Issue:** New runners were automatically created with "Missing" status  
**Fixed:**
- Changed default status from "Missing" to "Active" in `runners.html` and `profile.html`
- Added "Active" and "Inactive" options to the status dropdown in both files
- Updated `openCreateRunnerModal()` to set default status to "Active" in both files
- Updated `editRunner()` to default to "Active" when no status is present

**Status Options:**
- Active (default for new runners)
- Missing
- Found
- Resolved
- Inactive

### 3. ‚úÖ Runner Profile Data Preservation
**Issue:** Data was being cleared when editing runners  
**Fixed in both `runners.html` and `profile.html`:**
- Added proper data preservation in the `editRunner()` function
- Added runner ID preservation when editing
- Added console logging to debug data flow
- Ensured all form fields properly populate from existing runner data

### 4. ‚úÖ Runner Creation Validation
**Issue:** "Undefined" errors when creating runners  
**Fixed in both `runners.html` and `profile.html`:**
- Added validation to check if `currentUser` exists before submitting
- Added validation for required fields (name, dateOfBirth, gender, status)
- Added authentication token validation
- Added proper error handling for missing fields
- Added defensive checks in the finally block
- Improved error messages to be more descriptive
- Added data.id preservation when editing runners

### 5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Profile Image Upload
**Issue:** Profile image uploads failing  
**Status:** Identified - Needs backend API endpoint verification

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Profile image upload endpoint should be: `/api/v1.0/ImageUpload` or `/api/v1/image-upload`
- Authentication token may not be properly passed
- FormData may need proper encoding
- Need to verify backend ImageUploadController is deployed and working

**Recommendations:**
1. Verify ImageUploadController endpoint in backend
2. Check API authentication headers
3. Add proper error logging for upload failures
4. Implement image compression before upload
5. Add file size and type validation

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `index.html` - Mission statement updates
2. `runners.html` - Runner form improvements and validation  
3. `profile.html` - Runner profile form fixes for user profile page

### Key Improvements:
- Better error handling and validation
- Improved user feedback
- Data integrity preservation
- Defensive programming practices
- Better default values

---

## Testing Needed

### Manual Testing Required:
1. ‚úÖ Create a new runner ‚Üí Should default to "Active" status
2. ‚úÖ Edit existing runner ‚Üí Should preserve all data
3. ‚úÖ Try creating runner without login ‚Üí Should show proper error
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Upload profile image ‚Üí Needs API verification
5. ‚úÖ Update mission statement ‚Üí Verify it matches About Us page

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate:
- [ ] Test profile image upload functionality
- [ ] Verify backend ImageUploadController is operational
- [ ] Test runner creation with all status options

### Future Enhancements:
- [ ] Add image compression before upload
- [ ] Implement proper file size limits
- [ ] Add progress indicators for uploads
- [ ] Add better error messages for API failures

---

## Notes

### About Image Upload Error:
The profile image upload failure likely stems from:
1. Backend API endpoint not configured properly
2. Authentication headers not being sent correctly
3. File encoding issues with FormData

To fix this completely, we need to:
1. Check the backend `ImageUploadController.cs` implementation
2. Verify the endpoint is `/api/v1.0/ImageUpload` or similar
3. Ensure authentication is working
4. Test with a real backend connection

**All fixes have been applied to both `runners.html` and `profile.html` and are ready for testing.**
