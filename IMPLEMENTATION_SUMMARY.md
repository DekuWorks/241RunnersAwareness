## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### Real-Time Updates Flow
```
Admin Action → API Controller → RealtimeNotificationService → SignalR Hub → Connected Clients
     ↓
Database Change → Event Broadcasting → Client Updates (within 2 seconds)
     ↓
Fallback: Polling every 30 seconds if WebSocket fails
```

### Enhanced Authentication Flow
```
Login → JWT Token → localStorage → Auto-refresh (5 min before expiry)
     ↓
Route Guard → Token Validation → Role Check → Page Access
     ↓
Silent Refresh → New Token → Continue Session
```

### Deployment Pipeline
```
Code Push → GitHub Actions → Lint/Build/Test → Deploy to Azure/GitHub Pages
     ↓
Version Update → Service Worker → Update Banner → User Reload
```
