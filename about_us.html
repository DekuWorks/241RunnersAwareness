            <h2>About 241 Runners Awareness</h2>
            <p>When given the diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy for her newly born daughter Dione, Ms. Lisa A. Thomas’
                life began to make a drastic shift. After years of searching for the best possible medical care for her
                daughter and building a home in Houston, TX to ensure close proximity to the doctors which proved
                most competent to care for her daughter, Ms. Thomas became acquainted with an overarching
                problem she had never been exposed to previously. Lisa Thomas was exposed to the ever-present reality
                of non-existent childcare resources for her daughter and thousands of others with special needs.
                Armed with perseverance and an indomitable spirit, Ms. Thomas set out to aid in developing a
                program wherein she could offer childcare resources to the entire Houston community and in so
                doing, create resource and advocation programs for special needs children and their caregivers
                worldwide. This program opened numerous doors for Ms. Thomas and has borne fruit in many

                state-wide. Within her sacrifice of time as a foster parent. Ms. Thomas legally adopted five of the
                numerous children she fostered and continues to work tirelessly to ensure that the children she cares
                for receive the utmost care available in all areas of their development.
                After over 30 years of providing care for countless adults and children through the development of
                Group Home facilities, Adult Day Habilitation, Host Companion Care, and Respite for parents and
                caregivers, Lisa A, Thomas has proven that the world does include those who give all to fight for the

                triumphs as a celebrated triathlete and has founded a new non-profit endeavor for voiceless

                diamond in the crown of the global triathlon community.
                Lisa’s illustrious life as an athlete has greatly influenced her grit and determination as an advocate.
                Inside Lisa’s athletic accomplishments lives a new mission: 241 Runners Awareness. (241RA)
                This new non-profit foundation aims to create a unified dynamic identification database that will aid
                in identifying and tracking at-risk individuals by housing annually updated biometric information via
                technology. This foundation was inspired by the tragic death of one of Lisa’s adopted sons Israel.
                In March 2024, Israel ran away from home and then due to his compromised vision, was killed on a
                highway. Due to unliked databases, Israel was unidentified for six months despite tireless searches.
                During the search for her special needs son, Lisa identified several very large chasms in our current
                systems. 241 Runners Awareness will aid in syncing law enforcement systems with state and county
                identification systems in order to achieve a higher level of efficiency when searching for individuals who
                become displaced from their families. 241RA will also ensure that adoptive parents are provided with
                the adoptee's biological markers during the adoption process to facilitate medical treatments and
                traceability and encourage better media coverage of unidentified accident victims.
                Lisa A. Thomas’ presence on earth will prove to have lifelong effects on all that she touches. She is a
                superhuman individual who is empowered by challenges and finds strength in experiences that most
                people would never imagine attempting. Lisa A. Thomas currently resides in Houston Tx and lives a
                beautiful life surrounded by children who know her as ‘Mama Lisa’ as well as a host of family, friends,
                and deep community.</p>
