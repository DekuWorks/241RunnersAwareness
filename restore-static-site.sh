# RESTORE STATIC SITE STYLING
# ============================================
# 
# This script helps restore the original static site styling
# by triggering the new GitHub Actions workflow that deploys
# the static HTML files instead of the React frontend.
# 
# The original styling is in:
# - styles.css (main stylesheet)
# - index.html (main landing page)
# - All other .html files in the root directory
# 
# Usage: ./restore-static-site.sh
